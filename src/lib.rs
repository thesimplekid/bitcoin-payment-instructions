//! These days, there are many possible ways to communicate Bitcoin payment instructions.
//! This crate attempts to unify them into a simple parser which can read text provided directly by
//! a payer or via a QR code scan/URI open and convert it into payment instructions.
//!
//! This crate doesn't actually help you *pay* these instructions, but provides a unified way to
//! parse them.
//!
//! Payment instructions come in two versions -
//!  * [`ConfigurableAmountPaymentInstructions`] represent instructions which can be paid with a
//!    configurable amount, but may require further resolution to convert them into a
//!    [`FixedAmountPaymentInstructions`] for payment.
//!  * [`FixedAmountPaymentInstructions`] represent instructions for which the recipient wants a
//!    specific quantity of funds and needs no further resolution
//!
//! In general, you should resolve a string (received either from a QR code scan, a system URI open
//! call, a "recipient" text box, or a pasted "recipient" instruction) through
//! [`PaymentInstructions::parse`].
//!
//! From there, if you receive a [`PaymentInstructions::FixedAmount`] you should check that you
//! support at least one of the [`FixedAmountPaymentInstructions::methods`] and request approval
//! from the wallet owner to complete the payment.
//!
//! If you receive a [`PaymentInstructions::ConfigurableAmount`] instead, you should similarly
//! check that that you support one of the [`ConfigurableAmountPaymentInstructions::methods`] using
//! [`PossiblyResolvedPaymentMethod::method_type`], then display an amount selection UI to the
//! wallet owner. Once they've selected an amount, you should proceed with
//! [`ConfigurableAmountPaymentInstructions::set_amount`] to fetch a finalized
//! [`FixedAmountPaymentInstructions`] before moving to confirmation and payment.
